# mwdm_nonce

##What is this?
This is code from the Portland Maine Web Developers Meetup group presentation I gave on June 13, 2016, titled "Nonce-sense"

It describes the creation and use of cryptographic nonces with a timestamp and a GUID, to ensure timely and once-only submission of a form, using PHP and the mcrypt library.
